#Essentialism

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past module and apply them in a concrete project. 



## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your project manager.

## Description

You are going to create a multi page marketing page. 
In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.



## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

* MVP:
 1. An on-boarding process for a new user
 2. On-boarding process for user who wants to generate content (i.e. organize experiences for other local stay-at-home moms)
 3. Create a page that shows a list of values. User will swipe right or left (or tap a check or x button) if that value is important to them. (List: Athletic ability • Art and literature • Creativity, discovering, or inventing things to make a difference in the world • Independence • Kindness and generosity • Living in the moment • Membership in a social group (such as your community, racial group, or school club) • Music • My community • My moral principles • Nature and the environment • Relationships with friends and family • Sense of humor • Success in my career • Other: _________________)
 4. Create a page that then shows the list of values the person chose. Prompt the user to now choose the top 3 that are the MOST important to them. Then give students the prompt: In a few sentences, describe why the selected values are important to you. Focus on your thoughts/feelings, and don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or how well-written it is.
 5. Prompt to list all your current projects and things you’re involved in
 6.. Page to Compare your values to your current projects.
 7. Ability to easily edit / delete all data.
## Stretch: Notifications to reflect on comparing your current projects to your values monthly."


Your stretch challenge is to write the functionality of a `Carousel` component. You have the HTML and CSS already in place, simply un-comment the HTML in the `index.html` file. This is an advanced challenge, so you are not expected to be able to complete it. If you begin and don't finish, you should still submit with what you have. You may reference the `Tabs.js` file for assistance.

* [ ] Complete the carousel functionality in `Carousel.js`

* [ ] If you complete the Carousel, add functionality so that the carousel slides when the buttons are pressed instead of just appearing.

* [ ] Create an 'infinite loop' carousel. In which as long as you click on an arrow, the array of images will loop over itself.

* [ ] If you have finished the above, play around with the styling on all the components, and understand how each is built.
